# calculator
Personal project with The Odin Project

This calculator handles:
	- operations with two operands:
		- addition
		- multiplication
		- subtraction
		- division
		- modulo
	- operations with one operand:
		- percentage
		- square
		- square root
		- factorial
		
Available buttons on the calculator:
	- 10 digits (0 to 9)
	- decimal point (.)
	- 4 basic binary operators (+ - × ÷) + 1 modulo operator (MOD)
	- 4 unary operators :
		- percentage (%)
		- square (²)
		- square root (√)
		- factorial (!)
	- equals (=)
	- All Clear (AC)
	- Clear (C)
	
Available keys on the keyboard (tested):
	- 10 digits (0 to 9), both on number row and numeric keypad
	- binary operators:
		+ - / *
		×, or letter X as an alternative
		÷
		capital M key (for MOD)
	- unary operators:
		% (percentage)
		² or capital S key (for square)
		capital V key (for square root)
		! (factorial)
	- other signs:
		=
		'Enter' keys (both keyboard and numeric pad, for '=')
		'Backspace' key (for 'C')
		'Escape' key (for 'AC')
	

	

The calculator starts with an empty screen

Things to keep in mind (to implement later for instance, or just be mindful about):
	- factorial should be limited with regard to inputs
	- think about overflow in display screen
	- change cursor to hand when hovering above buttons
	- create animation when clicking buttons, to be mirrored with keyboard keys
